# Short Term Buy & Sell

Very simple strategy I created to play around with the backtracking library. It buys if ORCL goes up twice in a row and shorts if ORCL goes down twice in a row. This backtesting is using ORCL from Jan to Dec of 2000; during the dotcom bubble. Running this will show that your account inital had $100,000 and by the end of year 2000, it had $100, 173.74
